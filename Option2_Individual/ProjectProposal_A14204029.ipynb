    "Previous work to address this question has been conducted. First, a 2017 study of “Sociodemographic Factors and Food Safety Violations in Chain and Nonchain Restaurants” explored the relationship between inspection frequency, neighborhood characteristics, and inspection outcomes. Notably, the study revealed an interesting correlation—a higher proportion of black residents in a restaurant’s neighborhood was associated with a reduction in mean “foodborne-illness risk factor” violations, but an increase in mean “good retail practice” violations. On a related note, Andy Chang’s article for towardsdatascience.com explored this topic in context of the ethics of training a machine-learning model. He observed that generation of word clouds correlating to a bad health inspection score based on a restaurant name dataset led to prevalent words such as “Mexican” or “Taqueria”. His article details the ethical implications of teaching a model that, for example, “taqueria” named restaurants tend to score lower than “pizza” restaurants. \n",

    "I predict that health inspection scores are weakly correlated to median income in a given restaurant’s zip code. I believe this to be true because a business’s incentive to perform well is the rational self-interest of its owners and operators, in order to protect and improve their livelihoods. Customers are invested in the safety and quality of their food, regardless of socioeconomic status, which directly impacts business performance of restaurants, regarding health practices."
